file-system-based strcmp go brrrr


Story
You stir awake, blinking at the bright sunlight shining directly onto your face. As you begin to wake up, you start replaying last night's events in your mind. It seems almost like a dream, but the flag sitting on your night table indicates that it was, in fact, real.

Refreshed from the good night's rest you got, you suddenly have an idea. Bovik was a player in REFUGE just like everyone else. That means he had a player profile! You rush over to the administrative section of REFUGE, an area populated by colossal beige buildings and devoid of any players. No need to trek over here when almost all administrative functions can be done through your HUD.

You step into the large, dimly lit room of the records building. It smells old and musty; a fine layer of dust covers every surface. You have a hunch that there might be records on Bovik that wouldn't appear in his profile. Records that would clue you into where you could find more flags. Glancing at the endless rows of filing cabinets, shelves, and stacks of papers, you're not sure you understand the filing system of this mess. You sigh and get to work.
